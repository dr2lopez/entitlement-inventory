                A YANG Module for Entitlement Inventory
               draft-mcd-ivy-entitlement-inventory-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a YANG module for incorporating entitlements
   in a network inventory of entitlements.  Entitlements define the
   rights for their holder to use specific capabilities in a network
   element(s).  The model is rooted by the concept of the capabilities
   offered by an element, enabled by the held entitlements, and
   considers entitlement scope, how they are assigned, and when they
   expire.  The model introduces a descriptive definition of
   capabilities and the entitlement use restrictions, supporting
   entitlement administration and the understanding of the capabilities
   available through the network.

1.  Introduction

   The goal of any network elements included as assets in the inventory
   of any network service provider or enterprise is to leverage their
   capabilities to build network services.  Many of these capabilities
   are not automatically enabled upon acquisition; their use may require
   specific rights—typically provided via entitlements or licenses from
   the vendor.

   The primary intent of this draft is to support three key operational
   use cases in managing software entitlements and network capabilities:

   *  Listing entitlements (e.g., licenses) available across the
      organization, their holders, and applicable scope.

   *  Modeling the capabilities that entitlements permit or enable,
      representing what a device can do when properly licensed.

   *  Representing the actual use of capabilities, including any active
      restrictions or limits defined by the associated entitlements.

   Together, these use cases enable administrators to answer essential
   questions such as: What can this device do?  What is it currently
   allowed to do?  And what is it actively doing within the bounds of
   licensing or entitlement constraints?  This approach supports not
   only entitlement tracking but also intent-aware control of device
   behavior and resource exposure.

   As network technology evolves toward modular, software-defined, and
   virtualized architectures, managing the rights to activate specific
   functions becomes increasingly complex.  These rights granted via
   entitlements or licenses must be tracked, aggregated, and matched to
   assets to ensure that services can be delivered using available
   capabilities.  This complexity calls for structured, machine-readable
   models that represent which capabilities are available, permitted,
   and in use.

   To address this, the model relies on two core concepts: capability
   and entitlement.  A capability represents what a system or component
   can do; an entitlement grants permission to use one or more of those
   capabilities, possibly under constraints such as time, scope, or
   usage limits.  Being able to represent and exchange this information
   across systems helps automate entitlement administration and simplify
   operational decisions.

   This draft provides a foundational YANG structure for representing
   these relationships in a standard, vendor neutral way, complementing
   the network inventory module.

1.1.  Scope of the Entitlement Model

   The entitlement model aims to provide an inventory of entitlements.
   This includes the entitled holders and the capabilities to which they
   are entitled.  Additionally, it offers information into the
   restrictions of the operation of the different assets (network
   entities and components).  In general, this model seeks to address
   the following questions:

   *  What entitlements are administered/owned by the organization?

   *  How are entitlements restricted to some assets and holders?

   *  What entitlements are assigned or installed on each asset(s)?

   *  What constraints do the current entitlements impose on the assets'
      functionality?

   *  Does the entitlement impose any kind of global restrictions?  What
      are they?

   *  What are the restrictions that each asset due to the entitlements
      it holds?

   The model is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for
   expansion through the utilization of tools provided by YANG.

   The realm of entitlements and licensing is inherently complex,
   presenting challenges in creating a model that can comprehensively
   encompass all scenarios without ambiguity.  While we attempt to
   address various situations through examples and use cases, we
   acknowledge that the model might not be able to cover all corner
   cases without ambiguity.  In such cases, we recommend that
   implementations provide additional documentation to clarify those
   potential ambiguities.  The current model does not aim to serve as a
   catalog of licenses.  While it may accommodate basic scenarios, it
   does not aim to cover the full spectrum of license characteristics,
   which can vary significantly.  Instead, our focus is on providing a
   general framework for describing relationships and answering the
   questions posed above.

   With the aim of clarifying the model scope, here are some questions
   that our model does not attempt to answer:

   *  What are the implications of purchasing a specific entitlement?

   *  Which entitlement should I acquire to get a specific capability?

   *  Is license migration feasible?

   *  What capabilities will be allowed if I install an entitlement in a
      specific device?

   *  Features or restrictions that depend on each user.  We are not
      covering this in the current version of this document, but it
      could be done if we expand the holders' identification.

   This model focuses on the ability to use capabilities, not on access
   control mechanisms.  For example, if a router cannot enable MPLS due
   to entitlement restrictions, it means the organization lacks the
   rights to use that capability—even if access to the device itself is
   available.  This distinction is separate from, for instance, the
   ability of a specific user to configure MPLS due to access control
   limitations.

1.2.  Pre-Provisioned vs. Discovered Entitlements

   This model is not intended for automatic discovery of entitlements or
   capabilities through the network elements themselves.  Instead, it
   assumes that entitlements and their associations are either:

   *  Provisioned in a license server or asset database;

   *  Installed on individual devices and reported through management
      interfaces; or

   *  Manually configured as part of an inventory process.

   Future augmentations may explore capability discovery or telemetry
   driven models, but they are out of scope for the current version.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *  TBU Open Issue for the IVY WG, to include:

   (Update Glossary for Network Inventory draft.  We need at least
   formal definitions of "capability" and "entitlement")

   *  Capability: A function or resource that a network element can
      support or execute.

   *  Entitlement: A right granted to a holder (organization or user) to
      access or activate specific capabilities under defined conditions.

3.  Modeling Capabilities and Entitlements

   The model describes how to represent capabilities and the
   entitlements that enable them across inventoried assets.
   Capabilities describe what a device can do.  Entitlements indicate
   whether those capabilities are allowed and under what conditions.

   In deployments where entitlements are directly associated with
   specific network elements, the devices themselves may expose
   entitlement information.  Alternatively, some environments may rely
   on a centralized license server that maintains the entitlements of an
   organization.  By querying the list of capabilities and entitlements,
   along with their associated metadata, a NETCONF or RESTCONF client
   can retrieve essential inventory details about what capabilities are
   available and which entitlements are currently in place.

   Note that the model uses lists based on classes on multiple parts to
   be able to extend functionality.

   (TBD: Provide examples of how this can be done in future releases of
   this document)

   Capabilities and entitlements may be listed without explicitly
   identifying the assets (network elements or components) they apply
   to.  To support assignment, the network inventory [BaseInventory]
   should be augmented with two new containers referred as capabilities
   and entitlements.  These containers hold information of the state of
   capabilities and entitlements in the asset(s).

3.1.  Capabilities

   Capabilities are modeled by augmenting "network-element" in the
   "ietf-network-inventory" module in [BaseInventory] according to the
   following tree:

+--rw capabilities
   +--rw capability-class* [capability-class]
      +--rw capability-class                     identityref
      +--rw capability* [capability-id]
         +--rw capability-id                     string
         +--rw extended-capability-description?     string
         +--rw resource-description?             string
         +--rw resource-units?                   string
         +--rw resource-amount?                  int32
         +--rw supporting-entitlements
            +--rw entitlement* [entitlement-id]
            +--rw entitlement-id                 -> ../../../../../entitlements/entitlment/entitlement-id
            +--rw allowed?                       boolean
            +--rw in-use?                        boolean
            +--rw capability-restriction* [capability-restriction-id]
               +--rw capability-restriction-id   string
               +--rw component-id?               -> ../../../../../components/component/component-id
               +--rw description?                string
               +--rw resource-name?              string
               +--rw units?                      string
               +--rw max-value?                  int32
               +--rw current-value?              int32

   For any given element, the capabilities list MAY include all
   potential capabilities advertised by the vendor, and MUST include
   those for which the network operator holds a valid
   entitlement—whether active or not.

   The capabilities of an inventoried asset may be restricted based on
   the availability of proper entitlements.  An entitlement manager
   might be interested in the capabilities available to be use on the
   assets, and the capabilities that are available.  The model includes
   this information by means of the "supporting entitlements" list, that
   includes potential restrictions related to the status of the
   entitlement.  This allows organizations to monitor entitlement usage
   and avoid misconfigurations or exceeding permitted capability limits.

3.2.  Entitlements

   As in the case of capabilities, entitlement modeling augments
   "network-element" in the ietf-network-inventory module in
   [BaseInventory] according to the following tree:

   +--rw entitlements
      +--rw entitlement* [eid]
      +--rw eid                                  string
      +--rw product-id?                          string
      +--rw state?                               entitlement-state-t
      +--rw renewal-profile
      |  +--rw activation-date?                  yang:date-and-time
      |  +--rw expiration-date?                  yang:date-and-time
      +--rw restrictions
      |  +--rw restriction* [restriction-id]
      |  +--rw restriction-id                    string
      |  +--rw description?                      string
      |  +--rw units?                            string
      |  +--rw max-value?                        int32
      |  +--rw current-value?                    int32
      +--rw parent-entitlement-uid?              -> ../entitlement/eid
      +--rw entitlement-attachment
         +--rw universal-access?   boolean
         +--rw holders!
            |  +--rw organizations_names
            |  |  +--rw organizations*           string
            |  +--rw users_names
            |     +--rw users*                   string
            +--rw assets
               +--rw elements
                  +--rw network-elements*        string
                  +--rw components
                     +--rw component* [network-element component-id]
                        +--rw network-element    string
                        +--rw component-id       string

   Entitlements and assets are linked in the model in two ways.
   Entitlements might be attached to assets, and assets include (or have
   installed) entitlements.  The former way addresses the case of a
   license server, while the latter considers an entitlement directly
   associated with the network element.  An entitlement that is not
   included by any asset means that it is not being used.

   Entitlements may be listed in multiple assets.  For instance, a
   license server, functioning as an asset, might list an entitlement,
   while the network element entitled by that license might also list
   it.  Proper identification of entitlements is imperative to ensure
   consistency across systems, enabling monitoring systems to recognize
   when multiple assets list the same entitlement.  Furthermore, there
   are cases where an authorized asset might not be aware of the
   covering license.  Consider the scenario of a site license, wherein
   any device under the site may utilize a feature without explicit
   knowledge of the covering license.  In such cases, asset awareness
   relies on management controls or a service license capable of listing
   it.

3.2.1.  Reverse Mapping from Entitlements to Capabilities

   While the model includes links from capabilities to supporting
   entitlements, some inventory operators may need to evaluate
   entitlements independently and identify the capabilities they enable.

   To support this, implementers may use the product-id or capability-
   class metadata along with external references or catalogs.  A reverse
   mapping structure may be introduced in a future version of the model,
   once a reliable binding syntax for entitlement to capability is
   standardized.

3.3.  Entitlement Attachment

   The "entitlement" container holds a container called "entitlement-
   attachment" which relates how the entitlement is operationally linked
   to holders or assets.  Note that there is a difference between an
   entitlement being attached to an asset and an entitlement being
   installed in the asset.  In the former, the license was explicitly
   associated with one or more assets.  Some licenses actually can be
   open but have a limited number of installation.  Other licenses might
   be openly constrained to a geographic location.  We are not dealing
   with these complex cases now, but the container can be expanded for
   this in the future.

   The model accommodates listing entitlements acquired by the
   organization but not yet applied or utilized by any actor/asset.  For
   these pending entitlements, logistical constraints may arise in
   informing their existence, as there must be at least one element
   exporting the model that is aware of their existence.

   Some entitlements are inherently associated with a holder, such as
   organization or a user.  For example, a software license might be
   directly attached to a user.  Also, the use of a network device might
   come with a basic license provided solely to an organization.  Some
   entitlements could be assigned to a more abstract description of
   holders, such as people under a jurisdiction or a geographical area.
   The model contains basic information about this, but it can be
   extended in the future to be more descriptive.

   While attachment is optional, the model should be capable of
   expressing attachment in various scenarios.  The model can be
   expanded to list to which assets an entitlement is aimed for, when
   this link is more vague, such as a site license (e.g., assets located
   in a specific site), or more open licenses (e.g., free software for
   all users subscribed to a streaming platform).

   It is important to note that the current model does not provide
   information on whether an entitlement can be reassigned to other
   devices (e.g., fixed or floating license).  Such scenarios fall under
   the "what if" category, which is not covered by this model.

3.4.  Model Definition

   TBP

3.5.  Read-Only vs. Read-Write Model Segmentation

   Not all elements in the entitlement model are expected to be
   configurable.  The current YANG tree uses rw extensively for
   structural convenience.  However, in many real-world use cases,
   entitlement and capability data will be read-only from the device or
   management system perspective.

   Data can be classified as follows:

   *  *Read-only (ro)*: Installed entitlements, current-value/max-value,
      expiration timestamps, holder details.

   *  *Read-write (rw)*: Static description of capabilities and manually
      registered licenses.

   Future revisions may refactor the model to more accurately reflect
   configuration vs. operational state using config false statements.

4.  Use cases and Examples

   This section describes use cases, provide an example of how they
   could be modeled by the model, and show how each of the questions
   that we have explored in this draft can be answered by the model.

4.1.  MPLS Capability License on a Network OS

   An operator installs a software license (entitlement) enabling MPLS
   routing on a NOS.  The license is attached to a specific device and
   activates the "mpls-routing" capability class.

   json
   "entitlement": {
     "eid": "mpls-license-001",
     "product-id": "mpls-software-lic-v2",
     "renewal-profile": {
       "activation-date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
       "expiration-date": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
     },
     "entitlement-attachment": {
       "holders": {
         "organizations_names": {
           "organizations": ["ACME Corp"]
         },
         "assets": {
           "elements": {
             "network-elements": ["router-5"]
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

   "capability": {
     "capability-id": "mpls-routing",
     "capability-class": "routing",
     "supporting-entitlements": {
       "entitlement": [
         {
           "entitlement-id": "mpls-license-001",
           "allowed": true,
           "in-use": true
         }
       ]
     }
   }

4.2.  Bandwidth Upgrade via License

   A vendor-N device uses a capacity license to expand throughput.

   json
   "entitlement": {
     "eid": "vendorN-bw-10g",
     "product-id": "vendorN-bw-upgrade",
     "restrictions": {
       "restriction": [
         {
           "restriction-id": "cap",
           "description": "Bandwidth cap",
           "units": "Gbps",
           "max-value": 10,
           "current-value": 6
         }
       ]
     }
   }

   "capability": {
     "capability-id": "bw-capability",
     "resource-description": "Licensed bandwidth",
     "resource-units": "Gbps",
     "resource-amount": 10,
     "supporting-entitlements": {
       "entitlement": [
         {
           "entitlement-id": "vendorN-bw-10g",
           "allowed": true,
           "in-use": true
         }
       ]
     }
   }

4.3.  Floating License Managed by License Server

   A shared entitlement is held by a license server and consumed
   dynamically by multiple switches.

   json
   "entitlement": {
     "eid": "shared-switch-license-1",
     "entitlement-attachment": {
       "universal-access": true,
       "holders": {
         "organizations_names": {
           "organizations": ["NTT"]
         }
       },
       "assets": {
         "elements": {
           "network-elements": ["switch-1", "switch-2", "switch-3"]
         }
       }
     }
   }

   This entitlement may be tracked across devices using a license server
   asset that records usage or seat count (future extension).
