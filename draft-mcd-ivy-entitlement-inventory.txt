                A YANG Module for Entitlement Inventory
               draft-mcd-ivy-entitlement-inventory-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a YANG module for incorporating entitlmements
   in a network inventory of entitlements.  Entitlements define the
   rights for their holder to use specific feature in a network
   elements.  The model is rooted by the concept of the capabilities
   offered by an element, enabled by the held entitlements, and
   considers entitlement scope, how they are assigned, and when they
   expire.  The model introduces a descriptive definition of
   capabailities and the entitlement use restrictions, supporting
   entitlement admistration and the understanding of the capabilities
   available through the network.

1.  Introduction

   The goal of any network elements are included as assets in the
   inventory of any network service provider is to be used to build such
   services, takind advantage of the features provided by the
   inventoried assets.  The use of many of these features are not
   necessarily associated with the acquisition of an inventoried network
   element, as their use required specific permissions, usually in
   termes of licenses issued by the network element provider explicily
   authorizing the use of a (number of) feature(s).  As the technology
   evolves, making network elements more modular and software-intensive,
   and even fully virtualized, the management of these permissions,
   their agrgeggation and application to enable a concrete network
   service becomes more relevant.  These trends also imply the
   combination of greater number of these permissions, within a given
   network element or in a number of then, implying an increasing
   complexity when trying to assess the feasibility of providing a
   specific service by integrating the necessary assets.  This draft
   proposes a YANG model for incorporating the management of these
   permissions, based on two essential concepts: capability and
   entitlement.

   Capability refers to the ability or power to do something, often
   indicating a skill, talent, or potential to achieve a specific
   outcome, and is commonly used to describe the features or functions
   of a system or device that enable it to perform tasks.  On its side,
   an entitlement corresponds to the right that someone has to do or
   have something.  Following this general definitions, the model
   considers entitlements as the means that grant specific holders the
   right to access particular capabilities of one or more of the assets
   in the network inventory.  The use of these capabilities may be
   restricted in various ways, such as by duration, usage limits, or
   predefined conditions.  Being able to exchange information on the
   state of the entitlements applicable to network elements can save
   time and facilitate decision making.  This document proposes a YANG
   model that, complementing the network inventory module, can provide
   the information an asset/entitlement adminstrator needs for this
   purpose.

1.1.  Scope of the Entitlement Model

   The entitlement model aims to provide an inventory of entitlements.
   This includes the entitled holders and the capabilities to which they
   are entitled.  Additionally, it offers information into the
   restrictions of the operation of the different assets (network
   entities and components).  In general, this model seeks to address
   the following questions:

   *  What entitlements are administered/owned by the organization?

   *  How are entitlements restricted to some assets and holders?

   *  What entitlements are assigned or installed on each assets?

   *  What constraints do the current entitlements impose in the assets
      functionality?

   *  Does the entitlement imposses any kind of global restrictions?
      What are they?

   *  What are the restrictions that each asset due to the entitlements
      it holds?

   The model is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for
   expansion through the utilization of tools provided by YANG.

   The realm of entitlements and licensing is inherently complex,
   presenting challenges in creating a model that can comprehensively
   encompass all scenarios without ambiguity.  While we attempt to
   address various situations through examples and use cases, we
   acknowledge that the model might not be able to cover all corner
   cases without ambiguity.  In such cases, we recommend that
   implementations provide additional documentation to clarify thoese
   potential ambiguities.  The current model does not aim to serve as a
   catalog of licenses.  While it may accommodate basic scenarios, it
   does not aim to cover the full spectrum of license characteristics,
   which can vary significantly.  Instead, our focus is on providing a
   general framework for describing relationships and answering the
   questions exposed above.

   Withe the aim of clarifying the model scope, here are some questions
   that our model does not attempt to answer:

   *  What are the implications of purchasing a specific entitlement?

   *  Which entitlement should I acquire to get a specific capability?

   *  Is license migration feasible?

   *  What capabilities will be allowed if I install an entitlement in a
      specific device?

   *  Features or restrictions that depend on each user.  We are not
      covering this in the current version of this document, but it
      could be done if we expand the holders indentification.

   It is important to remark that the model primarily addresses the
   utilization of capabilities, rather than access control.  For
   instance, if a network device cannot be configured to use an
   arbitrary network protocol (e.g. MPLS) due to licensing restrictions,
   this implies that the organization owning the router (the holder in
   this scenario) is not permitted to utilize the MPLS feature.  This
   distinction is separate from, for instance, the ability of a specific
   user to configure MPLS due to access control limitations.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   (Glossary TBP.  We need at least formal definitions of "capability"
   and "entitlement")

3.  Modeling Capabilities and Entitlements

   The model is intended to facilitate information on all capabilities
   and entitlements associated with a set of inventoried assets under
   the same inventory management.  In scenarios where entitlements are
   tied to network elements, the element itself can provide this
   information.  Alternatively, providers may support something similar
   to a license server, which could house comprehensive information
   regarding an organization's entitlements.  Just by listing
   capabilities and entitlements, and reading their basic information, a
   NETCONF/RESTCONF client will be able to retrieve basic inventory
   information of available capabilities and existing entitlements.

   Note that the model uses lists based on classes on multiple parts to
   be able to extend functionality.

   (TBD: Provide examples of how this can be done in posterior releases
   of this document)

   Entitlements and features can be made available by means of do not
   specify which the assets (network elments or components) are actually
   assigned the entitlements, either through an installation or a
   similar operation.  For this, we augment the network elements form
   the network-inventory [I-D.draft-ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang-03]
   model with a new container called entitlement-information.  This
   container hold information of the state of entitlmenets in the asset.

3.1.  Capabilities

   Capabilities are modeled by augmenting "newtwork-element" in the
   "ietf-network-inventory" module in [BaseInventory] according to the
   following tree:

+--rw capabilities
   +--rw capability-class* [capability-class]
      +--rw capability-class                     identityref
      +--rw capability* [capability-id]
         +--rw capability-id                     string
         +--rw extended-feature-description?     string
         +--rw resource-description?             string
         +--rw resource-units?                   string
         +--rw resource-amount?                  int32
         +--rw supporting-entitlements
            +--rw entitlement* [entitlement-id]
            +--rw entitlement-id                 -> ../../../../../entitlements/entitlment/entitlement-id
            +--rw allowed?                       boolean
            +--rw in-use?                        boolean
            +--rw capability-restriction* [capability-restriction-id]
               +--rw capability-restriction-id   string
               +--rw component-id?               -> ../../../../../components/component/component-id
               +--rw description?                string
               +--rw resource-name?              string
               +--rw units?                      string
               +--rw max-value?                  int32
               +--rw current-value?              int32

   The list of capabilities for a given element MAY contain all the
   associated capabilities provided by the element vendor for such an
   element, and MUST contain all the capabilities the network service
   provider operating the network element has acquired an entitlement
   for, independently of it being active or not.

   The capabilities of an inventoried asset may be restricted based on
   the availability of proper entitlements.  An entitlement manager
   might be interested in the capabilities available to be use on the
   assets, and the capabilities that are available.  The model includes
   this information by means of the "supporting-entitlements" list, that
   includes potential restrictions related to the status of the
   entitlement.  This can help organizations stay informed about their
   entitlement usage and take necessary actions to prevent potential
   violations or overuse of capabilities.

3.2.  Entitlements

   As in the case of capabilities, entitlement modeling augments
   "newtwork-element" in the ietf-network-inventory module in
   [BaseInventory] according to the following tree:

   +--rw entitlements
      +--rw entitlement* [eid]
      +--rw eid                                  string
      +--rw product-id?                          string
      +--rw state?                               entitlement-state-t
      +--rw renewal-profile
      |  +--rw activation-date?                  yang:date-and-time
      |  +--rw expiration-date?                  yang:date-and-time
      +--rw restrictions
      |  +--rw restriction* [restriction-id]
      |  +--rw restriction-id                    string
      |  +--rw description?                      string
      |  +--rw units?                            string
      |  +--rw max-value?                        int32
      |  +--rw current-value?                    int32
      +--rw parent-entitlement-uid?              -> ../entitlement/eid
      +--rw entitlement-attachment
         +--rw universal-access?   boolean
         +--rw holders!
            |  +--rw organizations_names
            |  |  +--rw organizations*           string
            |  +--rw users_names
            |     +--rw users*                   string
            +--rw assets
               +--rw elements
                  +--rw network-elements*        string
                  +--rw components
                     +--rw component* [network-element component-id]
                        +--rw network-element    string
                        +--rw component-id       string

   Entitlements and assets are linked in the model in two ways.
   Entitlemenets might be attached to assets, and assets include (or
   have installed) entitlements.  The former way addresses the case of a
   license server, while the latter considers an entitlement directly
   associated with the network element.  An entitlement that is not
   inclucded by any asset means that is not being used.

   Entitlements may be listed in multiple assets.  For instance, a
   license server, functioning as an asset, might list an entitlement,
   while the network element entitled by that license might also list
   it.  Proper identification of entitlements is imperative to ensure
   consistency across systems, enabling monitoring systems to recognize
   when multiple assets list the same entitlement.  Furthermore, there
   are cases where an authorized asset might not be aware of the
   covering license.  Consider the scenario of a site license, wherein
   any device under the site may utilize a feature without explicit
   knowledge of the covering license.  In such cases, asset awareness
   relies on management controls or a service license capable of listing
   it.

3.3.  Entitlement Attachment

   The "entitlement" container holds a container called "entitlement-
   attachement" which relates how the entitlement is operationally
   linked to holders or assets.  Note that there is a difference between
   an entilement being attached to an asset and an entilement being
   installed in the asset.  In the former, we mean that the license was
   issued only for one (or more) assets.  Some licenses actually can be
   open but have a limited number of installation.  Other licenses might
   be openly constraint to geography localtion.  We are not deailing
   with these complex cases now, but the container can be expanded for
   this in the future.

   The model accommodates listing entitlements acquired by the
   organization but not yet applied or utilized by any actor/asset.  For
   these pending entitlements, logistical constraints may arise in
   informing their existence, as there must be at least one element
   exporting the model that is aware of their existence.

   Some entitlements are inherently associated with a holder, such as
   organization or an user.  For example, a software license might be
   directly attached to a user.  Also, the use of a network device might
   come with a basic license provided solely to an organization.  Some
   entitlements could be assigned to a more abstract description of
   holders, such as people under a juristiction a geographical area.
   The model contains basic information about this, but it can be
   extended in the future to be more descriptive.

   While attachment is optional, the model should be capable of
   expressing attachment in various scenarios.  The model can be
   expanded to list to which assets an entitlement is aimed for, when
   this link is more vague, such as a site license (e.g., assets located
   in a specific site), or more open licenses (e.g., free software for
   all users subscribed to a streaming platform).

   It is important to note that the current model does not provide
   information on whether an entitlement can be reassigned to other
   devices (e.g., fixed or floating license).  Such scenarios fall under
   the "what if" category, which is not covered by this model.
