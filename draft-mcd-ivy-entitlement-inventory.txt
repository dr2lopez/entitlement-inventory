                A YANG Module for Entitlement Inventory
               draft-mcd-ivy-entitlement-inventory-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a YANG module for incorporating entitlmements
   in a network inventory of entitlements.  Entitlements define the
   rights for their holder to use specific feature in a network
   elements.  The model is rooted by the concept of the capabilities
   offered by an element, enabled by the held entitlements, and
   considers entitlement scope, how they are assigned, and when they
   expire.  The model introduces a descriptive definition of
   capabailities and the entitlement use restrictions, supporting
   entitlement admistration and the understanding of the capabilities
   available through the network.
